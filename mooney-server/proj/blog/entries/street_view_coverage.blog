	I was delighted when I found out that they were covering Ireland. I was phsyched the first time I saw me gaff on it. 
	Maybe it's my voyeuristic side coming out but I like the freedom to go look at every thing about an area that draws my interest at any given point.

	I've been to China a few times and seeing as my wife is Chinese, chances of my going there again are pretty high. 
	Now trips to meet the in-laws may not sound like the most enjoyable thng in the world, 
	but when you consider I don't have a clue what they are saying half the time, it's not actually that bad. 
	Unfortunately, it can get a little boring if I'm just sitting around the apartment 
	(even with all the beer that Ling's Dad gets in for me), so trying to plan things around the area is an important 
	part of my holiday preparations. I recently found that the internet doesnt begin and end with Google. 
	There are other <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_of_Google_Street_View' target='_blank'>web firms</a> 
	who also offer Street View services. 
	According to wiki, <a href='http://ditu.city8.com/' target='_blank'>City8</a> had a service available even before 
	Googles service, although it seemed to be down for maintenance when I was trying to view it.
</p>

<p>
	One service that was working was the mapping service from <a href='http://map.soso.com/' target='_blank'>SOSO</a>. 
	Although the coverage is limited to the major Cities, the experience is *<i>very</i>* close to the Google 
	experience and offers interesting features like Street View from famous tourist sites. Which is perfect for what 
	I was looking for. <a href='http://photos2.pix.ie/06/5D/065D7470BE1640D493D6761B0E748A3B-0000316128-0003205797-01024L-D2544A86333746FC946923D28C4E3809.png'><img src='http://photos2.pix.ie/06/5D/065D7470BE1640D493D6761B0E748A3B-0000316128-0003205797-00240L-00000000000000000000000000000000.jpg' style='float:left;'/></a>

	Although the service is a little slow, this can be attributed to the natural latency that exists from connecting 
	to (what I assume are) China based hosts (12 hops to get to the <a href='http://www.rte.ie' target='_blank'>rte site</a> and 
	28 hops to get to the Chinese site [before i stopped recieving responses]). Barring the speed issues though, 
	there are some other quirks, like the whole site being in Mandarin. This can make it a little difficult to find 
	what you want, but a little searching usually yields some nice results...
